Right now the caracteristics of the printer are hard coded, to use it with another printer, you have to clone the folder and edit the width and height of the canvas to fit your printer. Be careful, the screen could be in portrait orientation, if your .pws looks like glitches, try to invert the width and height or play with the orientation of the canvas.
